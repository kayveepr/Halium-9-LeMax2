# Halium 9 on LeEco LeMax 2 aka X2
WIP for H9

This is a work in progress at infancy Halium 9 porting to LeEco X2. This is not a standalone porting but depends on 
LineageOS 16.0 repos and Erfanoabdi's ubports GSI installer.

Please refer to https://github.com/ubports/porting-notes/wiki/Halium-9 for more information.

Create a directory "local_manifests" under <parent_dir>/.repo and copy local_manifests.xml for LineageOS 16.0 repo sync. Else do manually.

LineageOS, MIUI, BaikalOS, AOSiP, AEX all P ROMs for Le Max 2 have been used to check proper functionality of X2 under Halium 9.

"apparmor" as default security. 

Issues: 

In all cases GPS works. Whereever both SIMs are detected data works from LTE SIM from slot 1. For calls use a SIm with 2G/3G fallback as VoLTE does not work.

Update Sep 2020:

Base ROM used AEX P.

AEX P - Both SIMs detected, in-call audio works, light, gyro, GPS and Camera(says 15MP/6MP for back/front cams), auto-brightness, sleep/wake via Power button. Ring on call buggy.

Installation Instructions:

Disclaimer: Sincerely hope the X2 device anyone tries Halium 9 on X2 as given here does not get bricked. Should that happen please bear in mind that anyone tries Halium 9 on X2 as given here does so at his/her own risk.

How to:

Method 1:

1. TWRP 3.3.1-0 for X2 downloadable from https://dl.twrp.me/x2/. 3.4.0-0 too works.
2. Download AEX P ROM for X2 from https://downloads.aospextended.com/download/x2/pie/AospExtended-v6.6-x2-20190728-1658-OFFICIAL.zip. This is a no GApps one.
3. Download Halium 9 GSI from Erfanoabdi's - https://build.lolinet.com/file/halium/GSI/ubports_GSI_installer_v10.zip - as tested.
4. Backup your existing data/ROM, boot to TWRP - wipe data. One may optionally wipe all on reboot to recovery.
5. Install AEX P or any mentioned P ROMs. No need to reboot.
6. Insatll GSI zip.
7. Reboot to bootloader and install halium-boot.img via "fastboot flash boot halium-boot.img" command(without quotes) giving appropriate path to wherever the boot img file is,
8. Reboot.

Method 2: 

TWRP requirement is the same. If AEX download is not available a vendor image is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CNi5ZkYKX3CiQg3jfuIobS6EEK16Plx/view?usp=sharing

Backup all your data for return.
          
1. Install GSI as mentioned above.
2. Reboot to bootloader.
3. Use fastboot to install boot and vendor images to respective partitions as below:
   A. fastboot flash boot halium-boot.img
   B. fastboot flash vendor AEX_Vendor.img
4. Reboot.


Pleas note it is WIP and adb sideload is preferred for both P and GSI zip so that one can avoid transferring files to device after wipe. Theoretically halium-boot.img, ubports-GSI zip file and P Vendor img files are good enough to boot and try Halium 9 GSI on X2. Please note that "not" all P ROMs or vendor img files work on X2 and hence use only what has been mentioned here. This notwithstanding one may find logcat filled with errors for FP and Camera.

For cameras to work - On CBG MIUI vendor copy over libbinder.so and libcutils.so to /vendor/lib from /system/lib. And for AEX vendor in addition to these two files vendor.qti.hardware.camera.device@1.0.so is also required.AEX vendor img file here already contains both lib files in appropriate directory,
